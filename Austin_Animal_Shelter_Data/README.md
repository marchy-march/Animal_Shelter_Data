## Interactive Map of Austin Animal Center Data 
This EDA project aims to map out the data provided by Austin Animal Center in order to visualize the rescue locations, animal type and intake condition. Although this project serves mainly as a way to practice and implement new tools for me, I would like for it to be a tool to better understand why so many domestic pets end up for adoption. The map can be used to analyze if the intake condition (i.e 'Normal', 'Injured', 'Sick', 'Nursing', 'Aged', 'Other', 'Feral', 'Medical', 'Pregnant', 'Behavior') and/or intake type (i.e 'Stray', 'Public Assist', 'Wildlife', 'Owner Surrender', 'Abandoned', 'Euthanasia Request') could be influenced by or related to the found location. This could potentially be used to develop solutions taylored to the community and to better understand how to help pet owners and pets before a rescue is needed.
